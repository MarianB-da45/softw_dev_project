## The application supports three user roles:

Admin ‚Äì manages users, sessions, and mentor-mentee assignments.

Mentor ‚Äì sets availability, accepts mentee requests, and provides mentorship.

Mentee ‚Äì discovers mentors, sends mentorship requests, and books sessions.

With features like skill-based mentor discovery, availability scheduling, and post-session feedback, the platform creates a seamless mentorship experience that encourages goal tracking, accountability, and program transparency.
